# KeepCloneDesktop
A simple offline Google Keep clone (compatible with databases from the app)

I started this so that I would be able to use my notes from Google Keep when I'm offline. I have tried to make sure the database format that this uses is the same as that used by the app on Android, though of course, that format may change.

The location variable in interface.py should be changed if needed, the location it points to requires the directory structure in data/

## Usage
To get started, just run run.sh in Linux. On Windows, you will need to change the working directory to src/ and run interface.py

## Screens
![Main screen](/screens/screen1.png?raw=true "Main screen")
![List adding](/screens/screen2.png?raw=true "Lists!")
![Deleting and undo](/screens/screen3.png?raw=true "Deleting and undo")
![Image notes](/screens/screen4.png?raw=true "Image notes")
